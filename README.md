Project Description
Create a fullscreen immersive vintage room simulation featuring a glowing filament bulb hanging from the ceiling and a retro metal toggle switch at the bottom. When the switch is ON, a swarm of realistic houseflies buzzes naturally around the warm glowing bulb. When OFF, the flies drop as if dead. The app tracks and counts the flies in real-time using a JS AI overlay.

The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
Everyone loves the comforting glow of a vintage bulb… except the relentless, pesky swarm of flies it attracts. How do you experience that vintage ambiance and keep track of your buzzing nuisances?

⸻

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An ultra-realistic fullscreen vintage bulb simulation with a metal toggle switch that magically summons (or kills) a swarm of flies. Count your flies live with an AI-powered overlay — because why not bring retro style and modern tech into your browser?
